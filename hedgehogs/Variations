Alternate movement
    
    Fizzy Lifting HedgeHogs
        If a player has no pieces that can be moved sideways on their turn (i.e. all are covered by other pieces), then instead they have the following option: in a stack that he has pieces, he can move the lowest of his pieces to the top of the stack.\

    Anarchohedgehog
The restriction that only pieces of a player's own color may be moved sideways is removed. Any piece may be moved sideways. The black spaces naturally become a space that no one wants to be near.

Alternate Black Spaces
    
    Urhedgehog
The black spaces are treated like normal spaces, meaning a player can just move through them without being stopped.

    Concrete Block
The black spaces become a different obstacle, concrete blocks. Hedgehogs can no longer enter these spaces. You can't be caught in them any longer, but they are still a hindrance.

Alternate Board Setup

    Backwards
The players could run the race from the Goal to the Start.

    Criss-Cross
The players play criss-crossing: half of the players run the race from the Start to the Goal and the other half go from the Goal to the Start. Pieces which are marked on one side as in variant 33 are not required, but would be very useful!
